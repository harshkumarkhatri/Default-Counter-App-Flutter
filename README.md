# default_counter_app

This app is the one which is loaded by default whenevr we create a app/project in flutter. The only change here is that i have implemented the functions and classes by myself(deleting the prebuilt one and making the new ones).<br>
This app gives the knowledge of how functions and variables should be implemented and how colors for the variables can be changed on the basis of different conditions accordingly.
<br>
The working of the app is similar to the default app where you are displayed witha floating button and the count keeps on increasing each time you click on the button.<br>
Things which are done in the app involves:
* MaterialApp class/design.
* Scaffold Class.
* AppBar.
* Icon and name change.
* Use of functions and variables.
___
Built using:
* Flutter.
